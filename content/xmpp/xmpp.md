# What Is XMPP?
[XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) is an encrypted, secure, and decentralized protocol that can be utilized for web chatting. Essentially, it's a much better version of IRC, and is much better than any of the mainstream messaging services.

# How Do I Register?
Follow the following steps to start using XMPP messaging:
1. Install an [XMPP client](https://xmpp.org/software/?platform=linux). Here are my recommendations:
    * **Linux**: [Dino](https://dino.im/)
    * **Windows**: [Gajim](https://gajim.org/).
    > Ideally, you should be using Linux for an optimal experience.
1. Create an XMPP account.
    * Select any server, such as mine: ```sykose.xyz```, and then enter a username and password. I recommend you use a password manager, and create a password with high entropy (randomness). Remember, anyone who types in your credentials can log into your account, there is no 2FA!
1. Start messaging!
    * Your account address will follow this format: ```user@sykose.xyz```. Share it with your friends!

# How Can I Host An XMPP Server?
It's very easy, I simply followed [this guide](https://landchad.net/prosody/). It should take you no more than 20 minutes.
**NOTE**: There are many features (modules) you can enable/disable, so read up on the documentation.

# My Credentials
Message me on my public account: ```kose@sykose.xyz```
