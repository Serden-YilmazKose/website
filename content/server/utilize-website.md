### Cool, I have a website. What now?
You are now on your own, you have to decide how you want to use your website. Would you like to make a blog, or use your website as a portfolio/CV? Would you like to self-host services like an email server, search engine, Wiki page, and many more? Well, you now can. You can get started with [Luke Smith's list of self-hosting services)[https://landchad.net/].

### I don't know where to start, what should I host?
I would strongly recommend hosting [your own search engine](https://landchad.net/searxng/), as a search engine is likely your most used and utilized service, so you may want a little bit of privacy.

### My website's page looks ugly, how can I make it look better?
You don't need to be an expert on HTML and CSS to have a nice looking website, all you need to do is use code other's have already made! I recommend you use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a framework to quickly build static yet beautiful websites. Read up on the documentation. I am using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), as probably made apparent on the bottom of the page.
