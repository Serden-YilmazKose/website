## Why need a server?
Owning a server, or renting one, is the easiest way to host your own website online. Although GitHub, and other platform, offer ways to host your own website, they will leave you with many limitations. When you own the server, you can start hosting a lot of services! To learn more about what to do with your website, refer to [this article I wrote](/server/utilize-website).

## How to get one
If you want to get and maintain, but don't want to get a headache over the smallest issues, I cannot recommend [Luke Smith's website](https://landchad.net) any stronger. Stop being an internet peasant, and become an internet landlord!
