# The Beginning
Have you noticed that people constantly, and wrongly,overuse **very** powerful words? Word like genius, obsession, addiction, trauma, etc...? Why do people do this?

# The Problem
When you overuse these words, you slowly alter the true meaning of the word. And I understand that languages change overtime, for various reasons, but why should we delibaretly devlue a powerful word like "genius"? If half a population is labeled as "genius", then there is no "genius". A genius in a field comes a few times every generation. If someone is somewhat profficient in some field, it doesn't make them a genius! Instead, it makes them somewhat profficient in that field. Everything is relative.

# The Solution
... isn't easy. Simple, maybe, but not easy. Be more careful with your vocabulary. Next time you want to use a superlative, think it through; does the subject merit the superlative of said adjective? Probably not. Next time you want to say you "hate" something, reconsider that feeling. A linguistically enhancing, and potentially spiritually enhancing, would be to not use the word "hate" for a week. You can replace that word with "dislike", "avoid", "prefer not", "refrain", etc... Find creative ways to rebuild your speech, you won't regret it!
