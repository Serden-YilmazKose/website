### What is SearX?
SearX is a multi-layered open source search engine that pulls results from tens of search engines to give you the most "accurate" results. Since it's open sourced, you can be assured it is much more secure and private than any other mainstream search engine.

### Do I have to code something?
No. You can simply use my instance. If you want to set up your own instance, you should first [get your own server](/server), then follow [this guide](https://landchad.net/searxng) to set up your SearX server. It should easily take less than 15 minutes for a basic installation.

### How can I use your SearX instance in my own browser?
Depends on the browser you have. On Firefox, you have to visit [my SearX instance](https://searx.sykose.xyz), and right-click on the URL bar. Then, click on ```Add "SearXNG"```. Then, go to your Firefox settings, go to ```Search```, and verify the ```Default Search Engine``` is ```SearXNG```. Now, anything you search in your search bar should take you to my SearX instance.
